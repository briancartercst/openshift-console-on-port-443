= Reroute OpenShift Console to port 443

The purpose of this is to expose the console on different port than the default
8443. There are ways to expose the console natively from master on 443, but from
what I understand there can be quite a number of tricky things that happen when
it is manually altered, thus we are going to try and expose as an Endpoint.

.Create Service layer


.Create Endpoint layer

.Create routing layer

.Edit master configuration
